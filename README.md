## About
SafeGP MPC is a safe intention-aware MPC controller for autonomous racing on a track with adversarial agents. Implemented are modules for autonomous racing simulation/data collection, offline global laptime optimization, Gaussian-process regression for opponent intent inference, and a safe MPC controller for safe autonomous racing. Additional documentation, demonstrations, and presentation materials can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1O63d1-YUX6T9cePRiIDy8zhiHLa1naHj?usp=sharing).

## How to Use
All dynamics parameters, controller gains, simulation settings, etc can be found in `config.py`. To set up a racing scenario, simply initialize agents, corresponding controllers, and starting states, select options for visualizing the simulation results in `run_simulation.py`, and then run `python3 run_simulation.py`.
